9# Merry VM

Merry is an attempt at reimagining computation exploration- a result of 2 years of architectural refinement. It is a powerful virtual machine designed to support multiple computation models, custom memory systems, and privilege-based control ‚Äî all inside a unified, extensible architecture.

## What is Merry?

**Merry VM** is an experimental, multi-model virtual machine ‚Äî built from scratch to explore **how computation can be simulated across diverse architectures**.

Unlike traditional VMs that stick to one paradigm (e.g., stack-based or register-based), Merry allows multiple computation models to **co-exist and collaborate** within a single runtime.

Each model is represented as a **virtual core (vcore)**, and every vcore can:
- Run its own instruction set
- Access its own or shared memory
- Follow strict or relaxed privilege rules

Merry is not "yet another toy VM". It is an ongoing attempt to rethink what VMs *can* be ‚Äî for learning, experimenting, and exploring systems programming in a deeply customizable way.

## Core Concepts (Implemented or Planned)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Multi-architecture Support | Stack-based, Register-based, Hybrid ‚Äî all via separate *vcores* |
| ‚úÖ Unified File Format | Modular format that adapts to new core types |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Multi-State Execution | Simulates context switching between different execution states |
| ‚öôÔ∏è MRS (Multi-RAM System) | Supports **Public**, **Private**, and **Shared** RAM blocks |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Privilege Model | Fine-grained access control per vcore |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Wild Request Handling | Interrupt-like system for async core signaling |
| üöß Subsystems | User-defined architectures running alongside the core VM |

##  Status

> ‚ùó **This project is in early preview.**  
> Testing is limited. Windows support is untested. No standard tooling or GUI yet.

This project at its current stage is for those interested in:
- Low-level VM design
- Systems simulation
- Watching a weird and powerful idea evolve

##  Who Made This

**Merry** is built by one person ‚Äî me.  
I‚Äôm a student, developer, and systems enthusiast trying to create something that lets people play with computing from the ground up.
