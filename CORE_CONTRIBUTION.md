# Core Contribution Guide

This document is intended for anyone who wishes to contribute a **new core type** to the Merry project.  
Such a contribution is both significant and deeply valued, as it directly expands Merry’s computational ecosystem.

## Overview

Contributing a core means developing and submitting an entirely new **core type**—a self-contained architecture that can run within Merry’s ecosystem.  
A core contributor undertakes the design, implementation, and maintenance of this core, helping Merry evolve into a more versatile and robust platform.

Each core adds unique functionality and computational behavior to Merry, enabling programs to solve problems in novel ways.

---

## Your Role

As a core contributor (whether solo or part of a team), you will design a new architecture that programs running within Merry can use to process data or perform computations.

You are responsible for your core’s full lifecycle—from planning and design to release and long-term maintenance.

---

## Responsibilities

As a core contributor, you are expected to:

- ✅ Adhere to **Merry’s global conventions and rules**.  
- 🧠 Design, plan, and implement your core’s internal architecture.  
- 🛠️ Maintain the core after public release.  
- 📜 Define and manage contribution guidelines specific to your core.  
- 🔄 Release updates, new features, and bug fixes periodically.  
- 🧩 Ensure your development team follows Merry’s conventions.  
- 📘 Provide **clear documentation** describing your core’s design, usage, and API.

You can think of a core as an **independent project** with its own repository-style structure—its own administrator, guidelines, and rules.  
The only strict requirement is that your core **complies with Merry’s system conventions**.  
Beyond that, you have complete creative freedom over its design, function, and development style.

## Contribution Process

To contribute a new core:

1. **Contact the Maintainer**  
   Reach out via email at **b09671522@gmail.com** expressing your intent to contribute.

2. **Submit a Design Overview**  
   Provide a document describing your proposed core’s **architecture**.  
   - It can be abstract or detailed, but must clearly outline the design concept and purpose.  
   - This document helps ensure your idea aligns with Merry’s overall structure.

3. **Core Type ID Assignment**  
   Once reviewed, your core will be assigned a unique **Core Type ID** used to identify it within the project.  
   For example:
   - `TEST CORE` → ID: `0`  
   - `REGR CORE` → ID: `1`  
   - Your core → Assigned ID: *next available number*

4. **Development Phase**  
   After receiving your ID, you may begin developing and testing your core.  
   It’s recommended to maintain a structured test suite to verify correctness and compatibility.

5. **Submission & Review**  
   Once your core has passed testing and is ready for public release, contact the maintainer again.  
   Upon review and approval, your core will be **flagged as ready** and officially integrated into Merry.

Additional documentation outlining the detailed submission workflow will be published in the **`docs/`** directory as the project evolves.
