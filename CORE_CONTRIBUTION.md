## Overview

Contributing a core refers to the submission of an entire core type meaning the contributor has decided to work on a new core type for Merry. A core contributor has accepted the task of creating a completely new core type to further improve Merry.

## What you do

As a core contributor, solo or as a team, you work on a new architecture that the programs ran by Merry may use to solve problems- the entire responsibility of maintaining which falls upon the contributor.

## Responsibilities

As a core contributor, your responsibilities are:
- adhere to the rules and conventions of Merry
- perform the internal planning and execution of your core
- maintain the core once it has been released for public use
- define and enforce rules for your core's community
- roll out updates, new features and bug fixes every now and then
- ensure the rules and conventions of Merry are followed by everyone on the team
- document the core as best as it can be done

You may think of a core as an entirely new repository of its own with its own admin, contribution guidelines,
rules and regulations. The only thing that Merry cares about is that the core follows its conventions and the contributor is free to do whatever else they want.

## How

The interested contributor should contact me via my **b09671522@gmail.com**. The interested contributor is expected to provide a document explaining the architecture of their design as they see fit\- abstractly or deeply but it is a must to provide a design overview. Once the idea has been reviewed, the interested contributor will be assigned a core type ID which they may use to identify themselves within the project or the virtual machine. For eg: **TEST CORE** has been assigned the ID of 0 whereas the **REGR CORE** has been assigned an ID of 1. Similarly, the provided core will be assigned an ID and the contributor may begin working on the core. Once it has completed its testing and is ready to be released, the contributor may contact me again. Upon reviewing the tests, the core will be flagged as ready and released. 
There will be a series of documents that will be released in **docs/** to describe the process of contributing a new core.
