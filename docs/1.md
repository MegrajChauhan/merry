# Merry Nexus

## Disclaimer

The documents provided for **Merry Nexus** are intended to help interested individuals learn about the project and understand its technical foundations. They describe the inner workings, goals, and underlying ideas behind the project. These documents will be updated alongside the project to reflect new features and developments. They may be shared, used, and modified by individuals; however, the author will not be responsible for any damages resulting from malicious modifications or misuse. The original documents, as maintained by the author, are factual and neutral in intent. Any harm arising from misinterpretation or misuse of the information is the reader’s responsibility. Readers are expected to meet the basic requirements described below before proceeding.

Merry is intended for educational and problem-solving purposes. Any misuse of the project or its software is the consumer’s responsibility, and the author strongly discourages such actions. These documents were written by the author and refined with the help of large language models (LLMs), followed by thorough proofreading to ensure factual accuracy. The documents describe **Merry Nexus**, not the entire system. The distinction will be clarified in future documents. Each **executing architecture** will have its own dedicated documentation. These documents are free and open source for anyone to use, but **commercial use may result in legal action**. The full documentation set may be compiled into other portable formats for easier distribution.

_Note: As the documentation structure is still evolving, future changes are expected._

## Some Terminologies

1. **Executing Architecture** – A specific implemented architecture that Merry can run.  
2. **Core** – An instance of any _executing architecture_ within Merry that may be running, idle, or terminated.  
3. **vCPU** – A virtual CPU that implements some _executing architecture_.  
4. **ISA** – Instruction Set Architecture; the list of instructions and corresponding formats of a vCPU, defining its _executing architecture_.  
5. **Merry** – Refers to **Merry Nexus** as a whole.  

_Note: The terminology list will be expanded and refined over time._

## Basic Requirements

Readers are expected to:

1. Have some knowledge of virtual machines, runtimes, or execution environments.  
2. Have a background in programming.  
3. Be able to read and understand English.

Readers are **not** expected to:

1. Have experience with low-level programming concepts.

_Note: The requirements list will also be refined over time._

## Overview

### What is Merry Nexus?

**Merry Nexus**, formerly known as the *Merry Virtual Machine*, is a set of conventions that enables various cores—each representing different architecture types—to run alongside one another and cooperate to solve problems. In simpler terms, Merry Nexus allows different **vCPUs** to work together even if they operate in completely different ways.  

An analogy would be a computer with two CPUs: one from AMD and another based on the ARM architecture—distinct systems that somehow work together. Merry enables a similar concept, except its CPUs are virtual and need not emulate real hardware. Merry’s **flexibility and versatility** make it possible to implement almost anything conceivable within the bounds of current hardware capabilities.

You can think of Merry as a **runtime environment** that supports multiple **virtual machines**, each potentially unique. Alternatively, you can think of it as a **set of conventions** that these VMs follow to collaborate and solve problems. Each interpretation offers a valid perspective. Throughout this documentation, we will focus on the main “**glue**” component of the system. After studying the documents, readers are encouraged to form their own interpretations, provided they align with the core facts.

### What is the purpose of Merry Nexus?

Merry is designed as an **educational platform**—a place for those who appreciate abstraction but want to explore low-level concepts without breaking things. With a wide variety of vCPUs, users can experiment freely, combining different architectures and behaviors. Imagination is the only limit.

For example, Merry might include three vCPUs:
- One counts the occurrences of a given character in a buffer.
- Another creates a window and draws a flower.
- A third simulates a stack-based virtual machine.

A program could use the stack-based VM to read a file and, if it detects the character `'f'` a thousand times, instruct the second vCPU to display the flower. This example is intentionally whimsical, but it demonstrates Merry’s potential for orchestrating diverse components.

This flexibility supports both **beginners**, who can learn by experimentation, and **experts**, who can prototype complex ideas. Merry still requires refinement to become a robust tool, but its goal extends beyond education—it’s also a **problem-solving platform**. The main challenge in this regard lies in the **creation of a unified programming language**.

Each vCPU has its own architecture, internal behavior, and memory structure, making a universal language that works across all vCPU types extraordinarily difficult—perhaps even impossible. Since a single Merry program may utilize multiple executing architectures at once, the challenge is significant. Overcoming it would make Merry even more valuable to the computing world.

_Note: Additional questions and clarifications will be addressed in future sections._
