# Merry Nexus

## Disclaimer

The set of documents provided for the **Merry Nexus** provide a way for interested individuals to learn about the project for themselves and understand the nuts and bolts of the project. The documents describe the 
inner workings, goals, and the idea behind the project. The documents will be updated accordingly with the project to keep up with the new features and updates. The documents may be shared, consumed, and changed by 
individuals, however, the author will not be responsible for any damages that may arise due to changes made with malicious intent. The original documents, as maintained by the author, will state facts and not affect the 
consumer in any way unless the information is misinterpreted and misused, in which case, the author will not take any responsiblilty. The consumer is expected to understand and fulfill the basic requirements described
below before reading the rest of the documents. 

Merry is intended to be used for educational purposes and problem solving. Any misuse of the project or the provided software is the consumer's responsiblilty and the author suggests refrain from such actions. The following
documents were written by the author but improved by LLMs followed by a thorough proofreading of the material to enforce correctness and factual information. The documents merely describes Merry Nexus and not the entire
system. The differences will be cleared up in the series of topics and documents that follow. It is to be noted that the documents describing each __executing architecture__ will be separate and dedicated towards that 
architecture only. These documents are free and open source for anyone to consume and hence the commercial use may result in legal actions. The entire set of documents may be compiled down to other portable formats for 
easier distribution.

_Note: As the documents have no solid structure yet, there may be changes made in the future accordingly._  

## Some Terminologies

1. **Executing Architecture**: Refers to the different implemented architectures that Merry can run.
2. **Core**: A core refers to an instance of any _executing architecture_ within Merry that maybe either running, idle or dead.
3. **vCPU**: A virtual CPU that implements some _executing architecture_.
4. **ISA**: Instruction Set Architecture refers to the list of instructions and the corresponding format of a vCPU that, in turn, correspond to some _executing architecture_. 
5. **Merry**: Simply refers to Merry Nexus

_Note: The list of terminologies will be improved as we go._

## Basic Requirements

The consumer is expected to:

1. have some knowledge of virtual machines and runtimes or execution environment.
2. have some background in programming.
3. read and understand the English language.

Consumers are, however, not expected to:

1. Know low-level programming concepts or experience.

_Note: The requirements list will be improved as we go._  

## Overview

### What is Merry Nexus?

Merry Nexus, or as it used to be referred to as the Merry Virtual Machine, is a set of conventions that allow for various different cores of different architecture types to run alongside one another in a way that allows
them to work together to solve problems. In simpler words, Merry Nexus allows different **vCPU** to run and work together even though they perform things in a completely different way. An analogy for this would be if you
had a computer that had two CPUs where one was manufactured by AMD and the other followed the ARM architecture- both are completely different systems but are forced to work together. Merry allows for something similar but
the difference being, the CPUs are virtual and don't have to virtualize real hardware. We will come back to Merry's **flexibility and versatality** later on but the ability to implement anything imaginable and possible 
with current hardware technology is possible using Merry. 

You can think of Merry as a runtime environment except the runtime supports virtual machines. The virtual machines, in this case, may be different from one another entirely. Another way to think of Merry is to think of it
as a set of conventions that are being followed by virtual machines to work together and solve problems. All of these different interpretations have their own reasons that I hope to make you understand. Over the course of 
these documents, I will strictly cover the main **"_glue_"** part of the entire system. After consuming all of the documents, consumers are free to come up with their own interpretations so long as they supplement the 
facts.

### What is the purpose of Merry Nexus?

Merry is intended to be an educational platform where those who love the comfort of the abstractions but want to experience the low-level without messing up, to join and learn at their own pace. With all of the vCPUs that
may be provided, anyone can experiment around with what they want. They can use multiple vCPUs that perform entirely different tasks and experiment with that as well. Imagination is really the limit here. Here is an 
example, Merry may provide vCPUs where, one vCPU's specialization is counting the number of occurences of some provided character in a buffer, another displays a flower on the screen by creating a window and another one
simulates a stack-based virtual machine. Now the program could use the stack-based virtual machine to read in a file and if the file contains the character 'f' a 1000 times, the flower can be displayed to the user! This is
just a nonsensical example but it gives you an idea of what is possible with Merry. All of this facilitates learning for the beginner while, at the same time, supplementing experiments for experts. Of course, Merry will 
require a much needed polishing before becoming a solid tool in someone's arsenal. Merry is, of course, intended to be used for problem solving as well. The challenge for using Merry as a problem solving tool would be 
the creation of a programming language. Since each core has its own architecture, internal working, memory structure etc. the conception of one programming language to fit all of that doesn't just sound challenging but
rather outright impossible.

The requirements for each vCPU will be unique at every level and hence, it is impossible to visualize a programming language that could handle all of the vCPU types. Since a single program for Merry could utilize multiple 
executing architectures at once, the challenge is quite a big one. If this challenge is overcome somehow then it will make Merry all the more useful to the world.

_Note: More questions will be answered._
