# Overview

Merry defines a lot of internal constants and it requires them as well. Right now, there are only a few 
constants but there will be a lot more before long. The purpose of each of those constants is defined 
below. Self-explanatory constants will not be defined here.

- ***\_MERRY\_PAGE\_LEN\_***: Defines the length of a single memory page which is equal to 1 MB.
- ***\_MERRY\_STACK\_PAGE\_LEN\_***: Defines the length of a stack page which is the same as a memory page.
