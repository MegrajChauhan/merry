# result_t

## Overview

Inside Merry, components can be divided into:
- Cores
- Interfaces
- Graves
- Abstrations

Cores have their own internal system and interfaces use **interfaceRet_t** to convey the results. The rest of the system uses **result_t** to convey results.
Below, I will describe all of the return values and what they might mean.

| Value | Name | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | MRES_FAILURE | The operation failed but the reason is not clear. |
| 1 | MRES_NOT_MERRY_FAILURE | The operation failed but it was not caused by Graves and the cause is provided via **ICRes** |
| 2 | MRES_SUCCESS | The operation went smoothly. |
| 3 | MRES_SYS_FAILURE | Operation failed but it wasn't Graves's fault. Either glibc or the host failed. |
| 4 | MRES_NOT_EXISTS | Something was requested but it doesn't exist. |
| 5 | MRES_CONT_FULL | Any built-in container accessed is full. |
| 6 | MRES_CONT_EMPTY | Any built-in container accessed is empty. |
| 7 | MRES_INVALID_ARGS | Invalid arguments were provided for the operation. |
| 8 | MRES_OPER_NOT_AVAI | The operation is not available. |
| 9 | MRES_OPER_NOT_PERM | The operation is not permitted. |
| 10 | MRES_COMP_FAILURE | The component fulfilling the request has failed. |
| 11 | MRES_RESOURCE_LIM_REACHED | No more resources to provide for the request. |
| 12 | MRES_INTERRUPTED | **NOT USED**(for now) |
| 13 | MRES_NOT_ALLOWED | The operation is permitted but uses something that is not allowed. | 

_Note: As more and more values are added, this list will expand._
