## Structure

### Structure Overview

Merry's internal structure is quite simple really. Each component has its own purpose and aids Merry to achieve what it is intended to do.

1. Graves
2. Soft Interface
3. Hard Interface
4. Utilities

The description for each component will follow.

### Graves

Graves is the central piece of Merry Nexus. It is also referred to as the Manager or the brains of operation. It is an event-driven component and controls the entirety of the system except for private structures of 
executing architectures. Graves handles things from initialization to lauching the very first core. Graves is made up of four sub-components:

1. Overseer
2. Graves Reader
3. Request Queue Manager
4. Request Handlers

The structure is quite simple and all of this complements the event-driven design of Graves. The event-driven nature of Graves ensures that it doesn't become a bottleneck of the system and remains idle when not needed.

#### Overseer

Overseer is the only active part of Graves. Unlike other components that need invocation from other components, Overseer acts on its own with the help of Request Queue Manager. Cores submit requests to Graves and Overseer
oversees that those requests are fulfilled correctly. Whenever there are no requests to process, overseer goes to sleep and waits for any new requests that may require attention.

#### Graves Reader

The only job of Graves Reader is to parse the metadata file. The structure of the input file will be provided in a dedicated document.

#### Request Queue Manager

The job of the request queue manager is to manage the request queue, as the name implies, as well as notifying the overseer if any events are queued. It also ensures that requests are queued properly without any race 
condition.

#### Request Handlers

The request handlers handle each request from the cores and provide results back to them. A list of all requests will be provided later on.
